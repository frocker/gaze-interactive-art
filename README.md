The app is now packaged with electron for a one-click run.
Works on Windows 32 & 64 bit systems.
Uses a Tobii 4C eye tracker (will run on other models, but calibration won't launch).

To export and run you will need the 'launcher' and 'electron' folders, as well as the shortcut.
(The 'ConsoleApp1' folder just contains the source code for the launcher).

Location of my Javascript/HTML code is:
electron/resources/app/
